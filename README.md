# Reach localhost database from local Kubernetes cluster

This is a small demo for how to set up your configuration so that you can run your database, or any other service, on localhost outside kubernetes.

* Kubernetes: I'll use minikbue for a local kubernetes cluster for testing
* Database: I'll use a simple python script to test reachability.
